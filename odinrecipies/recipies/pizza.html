        <p>Its hard to disappoint when it comes to homemade pizza, but it’s also hard to get just right. Dough tends to have a mind of its own, and how much sauce should you really use? In the Good Housekeeping Institute, we learned from years of testing that simple is best, especially when making pizza at home, and fewer [toppings, in this case] is more. While there are some appliances out there, like pizza ovens, that will take your pizza making skills to the next level, here’s how to make pizza at home every time with the tools you have, including tips from pizza pros.

            <h3>How to make pizza</h3>
                <ol><li><strong><em>Step 1</em></strong>
                    If you have one, place a pizza stone in the oven and heat oven to 500ºF (if you can’t heat oven this high without broiling, set to 475ºF). Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal.</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Step 2</em></strong>
                    On a lightly floured surface, shape pizza dough into a 14- to 16-in oval or circle and place on prepared sheet (make sure that the dough slides easily around the sheet, if not, add a bit more cornmeal). </li>
                    <li> <strong><em>Step 3</em></strong>
                    Spread sauce on dough, leaving a ½-in boarder all the way around and sprinkle with mozzarella and then Parmesan. If using a stone, slide the pizza off the sheet onto the stone. Bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with basil just before serving, if desired.</li></ol>
